# Additional Questions

### 1. What is your favourite feature that GCP or it's competitor has recently brought to market, and how are you intending to use it?
**AWS SAM Accelerate -** AWS SAM Accelerate is a SAM (Serverless Application Model) CLI capability to test local code changes against cloud-based environments. SAM is a framework to work with serverless applications on AWS.
 
Popular testing tools for IaC (Infrastructure as Code) that I've worked with, such as `terraform test` and `checkov`, were complicated and limited. Therefore, working with IaC has been a try-error of several `terraform apply`s. By the other hand, I've been seeing an increased adoption of CDK (Cloud Development Kit) and SAM for Infrastructure as Code. My goal is to investigate how well SAM testing capabilities could integrate a CI/CD process to accelerate the development cycle of IaC.


### 2. What future or current technology do you look forward to the most or want to use and why?
I'd love to understand how to bringing machine learning capabilities to build "self-sufficient" DevOps and cloud solutions. Could I mix CDK and machine learning to deploy a cloud infrastructure that makes "inteligent" decisions regarding provisioning, scaling, and disaster recovery? I currently have 0 knowledge to even start answering this questions, but I'd like to try someday.
